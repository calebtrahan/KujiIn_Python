        <br />Shinto:<br /><br />
            Inari, either and both a God and a Goddess of abundance.
            This availability to both sexes helps us detach the concept of love from sexuality,and teach us to love from the heart regardless of sexuality.
            While sexuality is of great importance in our human experience, we have to train the human heart to love regardless of the concept of sexuality.

        Buddhists:<br /><br />
            Aizen Myo, the Light of Passion where we see again a link to the heart and feelings.
            The Light of Passion is not the dense passion we are used to at the human level.
            It is the Passion that the Spirit experiences towards all things. It's only possible manifestation is a great love for everything.

        	Kai Is The Way Of Acceptance, Love And Compassion. By Accepting Yourself And All That You Are, By Accepting Others As They Are, By Accepting Everything That Happens, You Are Opening The Way For A Greater Experience Of Compassion.
            The Compassion Offers You A Way To Look At Painful Events, With An Eye To Seeing The Lesson That The Experience Is Trying To Teach You.
            Take The Time To Embrace Every Experience You Have With Love And Compassion.
            Get In Touch With Your Emotions; Instead Of Fearing Pain, Taste It Inside Of You. Breathe Into It. Be Conscious And Aware Of Your Experience.
            When Someone Touches You Gently, Consciously Feel It Physically And Emotionally. When Touched Aggressively, Do The Same.
            When You Are The Subject Of The Opinions Of Others, Whether They Tell You How Good You Are Or How Bad You Are, Embrace The Opinion Without Judgment, But With Compassion.
            THERE IS ONLY EXPERIENCE, AND IT IS ALWAYS A PERFECT EXPERIENCE
