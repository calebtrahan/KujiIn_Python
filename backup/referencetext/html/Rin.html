    	<h4>Power</h4>
        <article>
            Power Is Not Violence. Is there something inside of me afraid of power? Is power associated with violence in me?
            If I am afraid of that "power" inside of me...that part of me will limit and sabotage everything that I do.
            If I want it to have power, I must be conscious of the part of me that does NOT WANT POWER.
            FEAR of something, does not prevent that thing. Fear is not useful. Cultivate A Profound Desire To Let Go Of Definition,
            And Discover Yourself As You Are To Experiences, And Know That You Can Become The Supreme Being That You Desire Becoming,
            If You Stop Believing That You Are Not That Supreme Being At The Moment.

    	<h4>Everything And Everyone Is At It Is, And Always Will Be</h4>
        <article>
        	Regardless of what I define anything at all, It will always be what it is, regardless of what I call it or label it.
            How much does my belief of something change that something? Not At All.
            IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I BELIEVE IN, BECAUSE IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT ON WHAT IS.
            The amount of control I have in my ego in my mind about how much I need to understand the universe I live in,
            never changed anything about the universe I live in. Whatever I know of myself, is past.
            It's how I used to see myself and believe myself to be, and it's OVER.
            Any kind of personal evolution changes all of that.
            What I am is the consciousness and the ability to pay attention to what I am experiencing right now.
            I need to know my limits, however my limits are not my definition, they are not what I am.
            The belief that the more I know in my mind, changes who I am is FALSE.
            The discovery of myself can only happen if I release myself from what I already know of myself.

    	<h4>What To Work On</h4>
        <article>
        	When we first entered life, as a Spirit into a human body, we became alive without any kind of judgment of ourselves, thus without fear, hesitation or doubt. Our progressive human conditioning, mostly through unpleasant childhood experiences,brought us to be more than simply careful not to get hurt, but to fear and doubt ourselves. Now grownup, we believe we have conquered most of these fears, but it is not true. There are fears we would not even admit to ourselves so deep are their roots in our subconscious memories. We are not only addressing those cases of difficult childhoods. Even in a happy childhood may a child bump his head and not like it, and react with anger against the pain or with guilt towards the lack of agility, blocking some part of the subconscious mind with self-hatred for not being already perfectly stable. There can be hundreds of reasons why we defined ourselves with poor self-trust even in our first life experiences. Now, you can imagine the results of a difficult childhood added to that.</article>

    	<h4>Way Of Life</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>You Have The Right To Live. Letting Yourself Believe You Don't Is Preferring To Be A Victim Of Life's Events. STAND UP, BE CONFIDENT AND DECLARE YOUR RIGHT TO LIVE</li>
            <li>Do Not Compare The Value Of Human Life Arrogantly. If So, You Are Asserting That They Are Different Levels Of The Right To Live...This DESTROYS YOUR OWN RIGHT TO LIVE, TO BE, AND TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF</li>
            <li>NEVER JUDGE OTHERS AS LESS WORTHY OF LIFE THAN YOU</li>
            <li>FAITH RELEASES DIVINE ENERGY INTO YOUR BODY AND FUELS ALL OTHER SPIRITUAL ACTIVITIES</li>

    	<h4>Physical vs. Spiritual Enhancement</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>You must give up the belief that the physical body is not spiritual, or that the spirit is in some other place or dimension</li>
            <li>We use the terms physical and spiritual to describe different aspects of our nature, but these different aspects both exist at the same time, and in the same place in you, simply on different energetic levels</li>
            <li>Your spiritual, astral, energetic, and physical bodies are the same unique thing. They are all on the same frequency scale, differing only by their rate of vibration</li>
            <li>Thus, anything you do on the spiritual plane flows directly down into the physical plane whether you want it to or not. Therefore, Kuji-In is a spiritual technique that yields quite powerful physical results</li>
            <li>The RIN Kuji technique develops your ability to generate sustained energy circulation, or even intense bursts of energy when needed</li>
            <li>This practice enhances your willpower, your mental determination, and even the electro-magnetic output of your nervous system</li>
            <li>RIN will give you the strength you need at every level, because your spirit does not see any difference among your physical, ethereal, astral, mental, causal, soul, and spiritual energetic selves, aside from the variable frequencies they each represent</li>
            <li>Everything that comprises you is one single entity with a dense physical body at the lowest frequency</li>
        </ul>
	</section>
        <section>
    	<h4>A Quick Burst Of Energy</h4>
        <ol>
        	<li>Get the RIN fire coursing through you in 3 breaths, then focus joyful energy into your base chakra, spreading it throughout your entire body</li>
            <li>Tense every muscle in your body and hold that tension for 3 seconds. (Tensing your muscles will condense the energy, pooling it for your use)</li>
            <li>Release the tension without relaxing your muscles completely and hold that for 3 seconds</li>
            <li>(Repeat Steps 1-3 Until At Desired Energy)</li>
        </ol>
