            This "Conquest Of Person" Isn’t Just An Intellectual One, It Is Also Emotional And Animal.
            I am in charge, yet humble enough to observe what I am not in charge of,
            and the desire to be responsible on how I manage that flow.

    	<h4>What It Is NOT: Egotistical POWER:</h4>
        <article>
            When We First Approach The Concept Of Power, Our Human Ego Jumps In The Scene Shouting “This Is My Area! I Know How It Works!
            (Followed By Tightening Of Muscles, Accompanied By The Stimulation Of Hormonal Emissions, To Provide A Feeling Of Being Powerful)
            This Is A Mask The Human Ego Encourages, Hoping To Prove I Am Powerful From The Point Of View Of My Human Animal
        </article>

    <section>
    	<h4>To Attain A State Of Power</h4>
        <ol>
        	<li>We Must First Release This Biological Tension We Associate With The Concept OF Power (The Mask Of Physical Animal)</li>
            <li>Become Aware Of Universal, Spiritual And Personal Power As One Single Force, Unified And Free Flowing (Try To Feel Without Effort. Effort At This Point Will Only Be The Ego’s Attempt To Gain Back The Attention)
                Breathe And Feel. Let Yourself Become Imbued With A Feeling Of Strength While All Of Your Muscles Are Relaxed. Let The Power Of The Universe Grab You, Penetrate You, Imbue Your Every Cell. </li>
            <li>(You Do Not Control Power, You Simply Become One With It, And Then Influence It With Your Will NOT WITH YOUR ARROGANCE)
                It Is A Natural Reflex For The Human Ego To Arrogantly Compare ("I'm Stronger Than...", "I Am More Powerful Than..."). Every Time You Notice This Form Of Pretentious Behavior, It Is The Arrogance Of Your Human Ego,  BECOME AWARE OF THIS AND RELAX IT</li>
        </ol>
