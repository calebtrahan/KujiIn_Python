    	<h4>How It Works</h4>
        <article>
        	ZAI Establishes A Relationship With The Universal Components Of Creation: The Elements (Physical And Spiritual)
            ZAI Is The Basis For The Power Of Manifestation
            After A While, Notice Your Increasing Awareness That Nature Is Alive, And That You Can Communicate With It
            Nature Will Interact With You Within The Limits Of Natural Law.
            Eventually, As You Improve Your Sensitivity To Nature, You Might Develop The Ability To Call Forth An Elemental Manifestation When Mastered.
            This Is Not A Specific Ritual Of Manifestation, But A Technique To Enhance Your Creative Abilities

    	<h4>Concept</h4>
        <article>
            The ZAI Technique Consists Of Working With Our Mind, Heart And Body In Order To Define Ourselves As A Spirit That Is Having A Human Experience, Rather Than A Human Being Sometimes Having A Spiritual Experience.
            Pay Attention To The Dance Of The Elements Used To Create The Universe. ZAI Is A Prayer For A Revelation Of Truth.
            ZAI Asks That Your Spirit Show You What You Are In Totality, As Well As What The Universe Is And How It Operates.
            Redefine Yourself As A Divine Being Experiencing Human Life, And Cherish Your Human Experience; Each Life Experience Has Great Value.
            The Human Identity You Have Forged Over Time Is The Treasure That You Bring To Your Divine Self As You Awaken To Your Spiritual Existence.
            You Will Always Be YOU, It Is Only The Point Of View That Changes

        <article>
        	What We Seek On The Path Of ZAI Is To Become Aware Of The Act Of Creation That We Constantly Use (On The Spiritual Level) In Total Free Will.
            With Absolute Free Will, We Can Manifest All That We Truly Wish For, Simply By Desiring It At The Level Of The Spirit.
            With Free Will, We Are Free, And Our Will Becomes Reality.
            The Creative Elements Of The Universe Naturally Agglomerate Around The Desires Of An Awakened Spirit.
            This Causes The Desires To Become Denser, And More Material Until They Become Available To The Human Experience (Manifest As Reality)
