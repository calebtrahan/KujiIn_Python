    	<h4>The Air And Energy Breathing Technique</h4>
        <article>
        	There is a lot of free energy circulating in the air and space around you. This useful energy is called Prana; it is as subtle
            as air, and it is constantly used by your energetic body. When you inhale, you naturally draw air and Prana into your nose.
            The air goes down into your lungs. The Prana takes another route. It travels along the inside of your nasal cavity and up
            inside the cranial vault. When the Prana reaches the top of your spinal column, it splits and travels down either side of
            your spine. As you inhale, the air and Prana naturally flow along the correct path without effort or concentration on your
            part. Unfortunately, many of us have obstructions that prevent Prana from flowing to its natural destination.

        <ol>
        	<li>Breathing in, visualize the Prana flowing into your nasal cavity, and then flowing up into the inside of your cranial vault
as a 2-3” wide stream of white energy</li>
            <li>From there it travels to the top of the inside of your cranial bone, to the back of your head, and then splitting to flow
down either side of your spinal column</li>
            <li>At the tail bone (coccyx) it continues on to your perineum, (the tender spot between your anus and sexual organs) where it
condenses its flow and enters the base Chakra</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Breathe From Your Belly</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>When you inhale, feel your breath come into your nose, down your throat and into your lungs and belly. Let your belly muscles expand to move your belly forward.</li>
            <li>When you exhale, let your belly return to its original position and relax. Do your best to completely relax your chest and not use any strength to puff it out when you breathe. You should have very little or no sense of air going into your chest.</li>
            <li>First, practice by focusing on expanding and relaxing your lower belly. Your lower belly extends from slightly above the top of your pubic hair to your navel. Breathe in such a way that the lower belly does not move from below the top of your pubic hair. Avoid straining or any feeling of pressure in your genitals.</li>
            <li>When you can expand and relax your lower belly comfortably, turn your attention to moving the middle belly when you breathe, which for most people is more difficult. The middle belly extends from your navel to just before your diaphragm. Placing your hands on the lower, middle and upper parts of your belly as you breathe will give you clear feedback as to whether and how much your belly is moving.</li>
            <li>Finally, concentrate on expanding and relaxing your upper belly—your diaphragm and solar plexus—just underneath your lowest ribs. Try to have your diaphragm move downward as you inhale and upward as you exhale. This will help push air into the back and top of your lungs, parts that seldom get exercised. Eventually, you will be able to move all three parts of your belly in unison.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Breathe Smoothly And Deeply</h4>
        <article>
            As you breathe, make both your inhales and exhales smooth and full, without strain. When your exhale is full, your next inhale will naturally and smoothly arise by itself. Conversely, if your last exhale is shallow and not full, your next inhale will not come smoothly.
            You may have a tendency to hold your breath, gulp your inhale or even hyperventilate. Deep and smooth breathing enables you to take in and use more oxygen, better release carbon dioxide and calm your nerves. Over time, you take longer breaths, increasing the length of your inhale and exhale, without strain.

        <br />
        <article>
            To get the sense of how to breathe smoothly and deeply, practice breathing from a straw for a few minutes a day, in a smooth and steady fashion. It will help you tune in to your breathing habits, and, over time, help you overcome poor ones.
            Often lifetime habits of poor breathing can be overcome by practicing breathing with a straw for a few weeks.

        <h4>Exhale Fully</h4>
        <article>
            Exhaling fully will get rid of the carbon dioxide in your cells and lungs and decrease its buildup in your cells, which produces sluggishness and yawning, diminishes mental clarity and increases stress.
            Exhaling fully will also make it easier for you to breathe in sufficient oxygen and make it easier for your cells to procure it.
            <br /><br />You can do this in one of three ways:
        </article>
        <ol>
            <li>Exhaling A Little More Than You Inhale (ex. Inhale 4 seconds, Exhale 5 seconds)</li>
            <li>Extremely Rapid Exhale (ex. 1 or 2 seconds forcibly)</li>
            <li>Vary The Speed Of The Exhale (ex. Exhale 50|60% of your breath in first 2 seconds, then take 4 more seconds to exhale the rest)</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

        <h4>Never Hold Your Breath</h4>
        <article>
            Focus on not holding your breath between the end of an inhale/exhale and the beginning of the next inhale/exhale. Let one flow into the other in as relaxed a manner as you can. Holding your breath can cause emotional tension and jangle your nervous system.
            Breathe smoothly and evenly, without stop-and-start breaks or jerkiness. Involuntarily holding the breath both triggers and escalates stress.

        <h4>Keep The Tip Of Your Tongue On The Roof Of Your Mouth</h4>
        <article>
            As you breathe, keep the tip of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth. (If you make the sound “le,” as pronounced in the word “let,” your tongue will touch the correct spot just slightly behind your top front teeth.)
            Eventually, the muscles on the base of your tongue will stretch slightly and allow you to maintain this position comfortably, without effort. When your tongue touches the roof of your mouth, it continuously stimulates and balances all your body’s acupuncture meridians.
        </article>
        <br />
        <article>
            The twelve main acupuncture meridians of your body are all connected to points along the governing and conception vessels, which are two of acupuncture’s eight extraordinary meridians.
            The points along these two special meridians interface with and influence all the acupuncture points and meridians within your body. These two vessels form the chi pathway that is called the “microcosmic orbit.”
            That place just behind your upper front teeth on your hard palate is the acupuncture point where the governing and conception vessels meet. At this point, upward-flowing energy from yang meridians in the back of your body changes to downward-flowing energy in the yin meridians in the front of your body.

        <h4>Only Breathe To 70% Of Your Capacity</h4>
        <article>
            There is no gain in putting tension in your body by straining to take longer inhales and exhales. Because breath is such a primary human function, it is quite possible to negatively pattern yourself and lock tension into your nervous system by forcing your breath.
            If breath induced tension lodges in your nervous system, the tension and stress will far outweigh the benefits of breathing quietly, softly and deeply in a relaxed manner.
            By staying within 70 percent of your capacity, you will wean yourself from pushing yourself and gain the habit of relaxation.
