    	<h4>How It Works</h4>
        <article>
            After Practicing The Kuji-In Exercises For Some Time, They Will Alter Your Perception Of Gross Matter So You Will Be Able To Perceive The Different Flows Of Energy Composing Our Space-Time Multi-Dimensional Universe.
            As Mass Accelerates, Time Slows, Thus If Your Energy Is Flowing, And You Apply Your Willpower, Your Mass Accelerates, Time Slows For You And You Can Simply Change (Or Direct) The Flow/Motion Of Your Body Through Space.
            Imagine That The Atoms Of The Universe Are Composed Of Energy Waves Instead Of Rigid, Inflexible Solid Matter
            Feel The Flexibility Of The Structure Of These Energy Waves. Understand That These Energy Waves Build Your Body.
            YOU ARE BEING CONTINUOUSLY RE-CREATED!

            Split (The First Thing That Could Be Perceived As Splitting Up, In Creation, Is The Apparition Of The Concept Of Dimensions)
            Retsu Corresponds To The Multi-Dimension Universe We Live In.

    	<h4>Concept</h4>
        <article>
        	We Now Stand In A Transit Area Between Dimensions.
            Space And Time Are Only Definitions That We Placed Over The Mask Of Our Own Perception.
            From Spirit To Human, And Human To Spirit, There Is No Label, Name, Difference Or Anything Else That Could Be Defined In Ways To Separate In Levels Or Compartments
            RETSU Is Where We Transmute The Limits Of Perception.
            It Is Where Long Hours Stop Being Tiring, And Too Short Moments Do Not Seem So Fragile Anymore.
            Henceforth, Human Time Becomes Of Less Importance.
            The Same Thing Goes With Perception Of Space. Too Small Or Too Big Are Concepts That Disappear, Leading To The Appreciation Of Whatever The Size.
            From The Moment You Remember Your Wholeness As Spirit, The Eternity And The Size Of Your Existence, Every Measure
