            The "Inner Bonds" Are The Energy Currents Inside You That Connect You With Your True Self.
            By Reaching Deep Inside You, Into The Place With No Words, You May Get In Contact With This Same Place In Others.
            By Doing This, It Can Help You Gain An Understanding Of Why People Do The Things They Do.
            If You Don't Judge What You Perceive, You Will Perceive It With More Clarity.
