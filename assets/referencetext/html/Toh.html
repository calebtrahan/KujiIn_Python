        <h4>Gods In Religion For Added Visualization</h4>
        <article>
        <br />Shinto:<br /><br />
            Kasuga, a deer deity, is a messenger between our human mind and our interior spiritual world.
            The zodiac being the influences over our character and personality, it is compared here to the lower influences over our life.
            Many different things influence our decisions and actions.
            These influences come from others and from ourselves. Having conquered these subtle influences, we rejoice in our new life

            He is pictured sitting at ease, meditating, and the innermost of his six arms is holding a jewel of happiness
            and wisdom that grants the wishes of the devoted prayer.

    	<h4>Wisdom From Water</h4>
        <article>
            Consider a little stream of water that is trying to run its course between two mountains.
            Even if a giant boulder fell into the stream, obstructing its flow, the stream would not complain to the rock “Move out of the way!” and attempt to force the boulder out of its way.
            If the power of the rock to remain is greater than the force of the water to move it, the water will humbly flow under the rock and around its sides until it passes again on its way.
            Even though the rock tries to damn up the water, the water does not fight the rock.
            It remains in a state of harmony and keeps flowing on its own way, with humility.
            If you drop a small rock into a pond of water, the ripples will come and go.
            Eventually, because of the flexible and adaptive state of water, the pond will return to a peaceful mirror-like state, contemplating itself, contained in its earthly bed.
            Thus, the lesson of water is to peacefully contain yourself while you adapt to your environment.
            If you learn this lesson properly you will always be in a state of harmony and you will always have ample energy reserves.

        <ul>
        	<li>Learn to tolerate what is going on around you, and if it seems to affect you, humbly adapt your attitude to the new parameters</li>
            <li>Adaptation means adapting your understanding and point of view to the situation, and using the least amount of energy to flow in harmony with the forces around you, while holding firm to your inner truth</li>

        <ul>
        	<li>Expressing Anger In A State Of Battle, Fighting Or Conflict. (This Is You Losing In Favor Of Your Human Ego)</li>
            <li>Repressing Anger Or Joy. Repressing One Or The Other Will Only Hinder Your Ability To Develop Great Willpower, While Accepting To Express Both Joy And Anger Will Release The Pressure Of Inner Fighting</li>

    	<h4>Concept</h4>
        <article>
            The Ego Starts Off Any Subject With The Point Of View That It Holds The Truth, And That It Is The Most Important Aspect Of The Equation Of Life. Thus We Fight To Keep Our Fears, Our Guilt, And Our Sadness Inside Of Us, Like Treasures That We Cherish
            These Are Our Fights Inside Of Ourselves, And These Fights Consume The Most Of Our Life Energy.
            Pay Attention To Your Inner Fighting.
            Become Aware Of It To Dissolve It With Conscious Acknowledgment Of It.
            Use It To Fuel Yourself When More Willpower Is Needed.
            Know That You Are Life, You Are Inside Yourself, And You Are Not A Simple Human Thing Or Mundane Object, YOU ARE LIFE
