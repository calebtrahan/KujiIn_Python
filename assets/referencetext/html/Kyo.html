            <li>Troops: The Means Available To Us To Do So</li>
        </ul>
	</section>
    <section>
    	<h4>Concept</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>You Are Responsible For Everything That Happens In Your Life</li>
            <li>In Order Become Powerful We Must Grapple With The Illusion That We Have No Control/No Effect On Our Life Circumstances (This Is Our Physical Mask)</li>
            <li>As Long As You Hold On To The Victim-Stance Programming You Are Currently Using, You Will Be Blaming Others Or Life Or Circumstances For What Manifests In Your Life</li>
            <li>IN ORDER TO GAIN THE POWER TO MANIFEST WHAT YOU TRULY WANT, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO REPROGRAM YOUR THINKING SO YOU TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU</li>
        </ul>
	</section>
    <section>
    	<h4>What It Is Not</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>CONTROL
            	<ul>
                	<li>Control Is A State Of Mind Where You Mentally Pressure Yourself And Others Into A Set Of Predefined Expectations</li>
					<li>Control Is Also FIGHTING AGAINST ALL THAT WOULD WORK IN WAYS DIFFERENT THAN YOUR EXPECTATIONS</li>
                    <li>Control is the opposite of letting go, Control is a temporary and hopeless way for the human ego to simulate a state of success</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>GUILT/FAULT
            	<ul>
                	<li>The concept of fault and responsibility are two different things</li>
                    <li>Fault is maintained by an emotional attachment to guilt</li>
                    <li>Guilt is result of a self-judgment that you have been refusing to become conscious of</li>
                    <li>When we look at the concepts of fault and guilt, we see that the human ego tends to play the victim for what happened and wants to sink into the self-abusive, self-defeating shame of what it did</li>
                    <li>This creates a war against the self, which is maintained in order to prevent conscious awareness. Conscious awareness at every level is mandatory for personal evolution and transformation</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <section>
    	<h4>Self-Mastery</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>Mastery is a way to act from a point of view of consciousness. It is an awareness of the forces in operation, and an influence on their direction</li>
            <li>Mastery is not fighting against a force, but an awareness of that force,triggering its unraveling, or calming it from within</li>
			<li>Mastery relaxes a pressure rather than fight against it. With our example of anger, mastery would start with a conscious contact with the emotional reaction, and work its way into relaxing it using tools such as compassion, tolerance and responsibility</li>
            <li>A person in a state of self-mastery does not fight with an emotional pressure, but seamlessly releases it with awareness, using forgiveness and emotional transmutation</li>
            <li>The emotional energy thus becomes available again, regenerating the master instead of depleting his strength and life force</li>
        </ul>
	</section>
    <section>
    	<h4>Concept</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>An Awareness Of Forces In Operation And An Influence On Their Direction. (Not Fighting Against A Force)</li>
            <li>An Awareness Of That Force, Triggering Its Unraveling And Calming It From Within. (Relaxing The Force Rather Than Fighting Against It)</li>
        </ul>
	</section>
    <section>
    	<h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>Let Go Of Control By Responsibly Accepting Whatever Happens To Me</li>
            <li>Take Command By Acting In Ways To Produce The Results I Wish To Manifest</li>
        </ul>
	</section>
    <section>
    	<h4>Conscious Evolution With Kuji-In</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>When you are consistently performing the philosophical contemplation described above, you will begin to see changes in your personal life</li>
            <li>Everyone has tiny balls of clogged energy that obstruct one or more of their energetic channels</li>
            <li>Your use of the Kuji-In techniques will enhance your spiritual experience by safely and effectively clearing out those obstructions, one or more at a time. The material that was clogging your channel is then released, sent back to the Universe</li>
            <li>Eventually, some of this dispersed energy may re-manifest the events that lead to whatever caused the blockage in the first place, offering you an opportunity to resolve this issue once and for all</li>
            <li>Thus, even though the energy clogs are dispersed into the Universe, they can result in the reappearance of previous trials and life-challenges if you have not mastered the karmic lesson associated with them</li>
        </ul>
