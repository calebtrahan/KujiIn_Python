<p>I have built into the application a simple goal setting, achieving and tracking feature. I'll go over the basics to this in this short overview.</p>
<h3>Setting Goals:</h3>
<p>In order to begin to use this feature, you must first set a goal. To do this click 'NEW GOAL' on the bottom left of the application.</p>
<p>You will be presented with a dialog asking what your goal is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Number Of Goal Hours (Only whole numbers accepted right now)</li>
  <li>When You Want To Achieve That Goal (Click the little arrow to be presented with a little calendar date-select widget)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Rules for goals:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Must not be 0 hrs.</li>
  <li>Goal hours you are setting must be greater than:
    <ol>
      <li>You Current Practiced Hours (Displayed at the top of the 'New Goal' Dialog)</li>
      <li>Any other set goals</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Goal date must be after:
    <ol>
      <li>Today's Date</li>
      <li>The latest date of all your goals</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: I will check this when you click the 'SET THIS GOAL' button on the New Goal Dialog and display a warning if one of the rules isn't met (above)</p>
<h3>Tracking Goals:</h3>
<p>Once you have successfully set a goal, it will be tracked in the lower left hand side, and updated on program launch and after each session you complete.</p>
<p>Like so:</p>
<p>[current hours practiced] [%completed] [goal hours]</p>
<h3>Calculating Practice Time Per Day To Reach The Goal (Goal Pacing)</h3>
<p>Click The 'GOAL PACING' Button In The Lower Left (This Will Only Work If At Least 1 Goal is Set)</p>
<p>You Will Be Presented With A Dialog Asking How Many Days/wk You Want To Work Towards This Goal</p>
<p>After You Put In The Days A Week And Click Calculate, A Dialog Will Tell You How Many Hours (And Minutes) x Times A Week You Need To Work On That Goal</p>
<h3>Viewing Active Goals</h3>
<p>Click 'VIEW GOALS' In The Bottom Left. You Will Be Presented With A List Of All Active Goals</p>
<h3>Viewing Inactive/Completed Goals</h3>
<p>Click 'COMPLETED GOALS' In The Bottom Left. You Will Be Presented With A List Of All Completed Goals, With The Date You Completed Each Goal.</p>
