<h3>Creating Sessions</h3>
<p>There are 2 parts to sessions that you can create.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Entrainment (See below)</li>
  <li>Ambience (Covered in the ambience section)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Steps To Creating A Session:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Start by dragging the sliders on the left to increase/decrease the number of minutes for each cut</li>
  <li>If you want you can add a pre (PRE) and post (POST) session. These are just contemplative meditation before and/or after you work on the cuts.</li>
  <li>Since the brainwave entrainment slowly guides your mind towards a certain state (Attuned with the relative Chakras for each cut), there is a 2 minute ramp into and out of the session.</li>
  <li>After you have selected the cuts you have worked on, click the CREATE button at the bottom of the program. You will be presented with a summary of what you have selected, along with a couple of checks to make sure everything is good before starting to create the session</li>
</ol>
<h4>Guidelines For Session Creation:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>There doesn't have to be a value for each cut. However, it is best to start with RIN (for 2-3 min and due a couple minutes of each cut before the cut you are doing the major work on.</li>
  <li>Make sure the cuts you are working on connect. Meaning that if you want to work on Sha And Zai, you need to work on the cuts in between (Kai, Jin, Retsu) for at least a couple minutes in order for me to create the session due to the differences in frequencies between non-connecting cuts</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are planning on using ambience, click the CLOSE button and then the Adding Ambience button and follow those instruction before clicking CREATE to create the session.</p>
