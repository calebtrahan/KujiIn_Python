<p>If you would like to display some information on different cuts you are working on, while you are working on them (without distracting you while you practice), I have built this feature in to do just that.
</p>
<p>If you need information to put in here, I would definitely recommend Maha Vajra's books on the Kuji-In you can purchase from his website <a href="#" title="Heavenly Light Store">http://www.heavenlightstore.com</a>. I have adapted most of the content I use for my personal reference files from his books.</p>
<p>Once you have content to place into the reference files, there are 2 different options for displaying that content:</p>
<p>Before using this feature, you must add content to the reference files:</p>
<h3>Basic Text Files</h3>
<p>A Text File For Each Cut (Including Pre + Postsession) Is In:</p>
<p>[WHERE YOU INSTALLED THE PROGRAM]\lib\referencefiles\txt\</p>
<p>Add whatever text you would like to each file in there using wordpad, notepad or any plain text editor you prefer.</p>
<p>There must be at least 3 lines of text in each  .txt file (including presession and postsession) in order to use this feature.</p>
<h3>HTML Formatted Files</h3>
<p>If you would like to style your information with colors and such, you can place formatted html content in each cut's (including pressession and postsession).html file in:</p>
<p>[WHERE YOU INSTALLED THE PROGRAM]\lib\referencefiles\html\ </p>
<p>If you don't know how to write html, and you still want to use this feature, there are plenty of HTML editors that allow you to this without manually coding in raw HTML.</p>
<p>A couple I recommend:</p>
<p><a href="#">Adobe Dreamweaver</a> (This is what I use and as far as I know it's the best web design tool out there. It does cost money, but they have a 30-day free trial if you want to try it out)</p>
<p><a href="#">SeaMonkey</a> (free)</p>
<p><a href="#">Kompozer</a> (free)</p>
<p>All three of these allow you to write the text into the HTML document and it automatically adds all necessary html code to the document.</p>
<p>There must be at least 3 lines of formatted html code in each .html file (including presession and postsession) in order to use this feature.</p>
<h3>Adding Reference Files To Session</h3>
<p>After you have added content into all of the .html or .txt files respectively, you can now add it into the session to be displayed while you are practicing.</p>
<p>To do this, check the box at the bottom left named 'REFERENCE FILES'.</p>
<p>You will be presented a dialog with 2 options. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Click HTML if you have added content to each .html file and would like to display HTML files.</li>
  <li>Click TXT if you have added content to each .txt file and would like to display TXT files.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: If you have not added content to each file (including presession and postsession) the files will not display during playback.</p>
<p>If the checkbox stays checked after you click HTML or TXT, you are all good. The display files will be automatically displayed for each cut you work on when playing a session.</p>
