<p>I have built in a feature to make it difficult to end a started session before the end of that created session.</p>
<p>I have found this feature to be very helpful for me, and has greatly increased my practice of the Kuji-In.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that if you try to end a session early, you have to put in the reason why, and alot of times for me personally I write out the reason, and I decide that reason isn't worth cutting off my progress early and I continue the session.</p>
<h3>Ending A Session Early</h3>
<p>I have built in a check into the program when you close the program, so if you need to end a session early, simply click the 'X' at the very top right, and you will be prompted with a dialog.</p>
<p>The dialog will ask you why you are asking the session early, and after you reach this dialog and write it out, if you decide that reason isn't worth ending the session early, you can click 'RESUME SESSION' and you will continue the session right where you left off.</p>
<p>If you decide it is worth it, and put in a reason, the session (and the program) will close, and these are stored in your program's database and can be viewed when you click 'PREMATURE ENDINGS' from the main program screen right below the 'LIST OF SESSIONS' button.</p>
