<h3>Exporting Sessions</h3>
<p>This is a really cool feature I built in. It allows you to use the sessions you design in this program, and export them to a .mp3 file you can use whenever, wherever.</p>
<p>To Export Sessions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A Session must first be created.</li>
  <li>Click the export button, and it will open up Windows Explorer (or whichever default file browser is on your OS) asking you where you want to save the file (in .mp3 format)</li>
  <li>After you enter your name, click 'OK' And your session will export</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: This takes a while if you have ambience in your session, because I need to join entrainment with ambience, and that is not a very quick process (depending of course on how fast your computer is)</p>
<p>Also, I added a prompt at the end of each completed session to export that session. If you really enjoyed the session you just practiced, export it at the end using the prompt provided.</p>
