<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot include any ambience with this program. Most if not all music files (including ambience) are the property of their respective owners, and I do not own the rights to distribute ambience files to everyone who would use this program.</p>
<p>However, if you have ambience that you would like to play, I will explain in this guide how to use it with the program. If you do not know where to get Ambience, I recommend a subscription to Magnatune.com, which will allow you to download (as part of a monthly subscription) as much ambience as you like. I have gotten most of the ambience I use from this company.</p>
<h3>Adding Ambience To The Project Directory:</h3>
<p>In order for the program to use the ambience, it must be placed in a specific directory. Starting from where you installed the program (I will call PROGRAMDIR below), here is where to place the ambience.</p>
<p>NOTE: All Ambience Files Must Be In .mp3 Format To Be Recognized By The Program</p>
<p>There are 2 different options for ambience:</p>
<ol>
  <li>General Ambience. This is a big (or small) list of files to be played for the whole session, regardless of which cut is playing.</li>
  <li>Specific Ambience. This is if you want to play ambience for each individual cut seperately. For example, if you have a certain file (or files) you want to listen to during RIN, but different files you want to listen to during KAI or any other cut, my program will play the ambience in that folder for each specific cut, giving a great deal of variety to the sessions you create.</li>
</ol>
<h4>General Ambience:</h4>
<p>Place the files in: PROGRAMDIR\sound\ambience\general\ </p>
<p>The more files you place in here the better. My program will play the files at random, so the more you have the more diverse the ambience in the session will be. If there are not enough ambience files to play unique files for the length of the session, the ambience will automatically loop in random order, so the more you have the more random and diverse the ambience will be</p>
<p>MUST HAVE AT LEAST 3 FILES IN THE  PROGRAMDIR\sound\ambience\general\ IN ORDER TO USE GENERAL AMBIENCE</p>
<h4>Specific Ambience:</h4>
<p>Place The Files In:</p>
<p>PROGRAMDIR\sound\ambience\rin    (These will be played while practicing RIN)</p>
<p>PROGRAMDIR\sound\ambience\kyo    (These will be played while practicing KYO)</p>
<p>...and so on for each cut</p>
<p>Also, place files in the PROGRAMDIR\sound\ambience\presession and PROGRAMDIR\sound\ambience\postsession as well to use this feature</p>
<p>MUST HAVE AT LEAST 2 AMBIENCE FILES IN EACH DIRECTORY (INCLUDING presession AND postsession) IN ORDER TO USE THIS FEATURE</p>
<h3>Adding Ambience To The Session:</h3>
<p>With one of the ambience types (general or specific) guidelines met. Click the ambience checkbox in the bottom left. You will be presented with a dialog to select which type of ambience (specific or general) you would like and after clicking, the program will verify that the guidelines (ABOVE) are met. And if so, the ambience will be automatically added to the program when you click the CREATE button.</p>
<p>If The Ambience Box Stays Ticked, All Checks Were Passed And You Are Good To Go, The Ambience Is Successfully Added To The Session. Click CREATE and the session will create both the entrainment, and also randomized ambience that will play with the session when you click PLAY</p>
