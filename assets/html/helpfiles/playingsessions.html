<h3>Playing Sessions</h3>
<p>You must create a session before playing it. If not you will get an error.</p>
<p>After the session has been successfully created, hit the 'PLAY' Button.</p>
<p>When the dialog with  tips for good session playback appears, click the 'Begin Playback' Button, And your session will begin playing.</p>
<p>Status updates will show on the lower left (on the status bar), telling you how far into the practice you are, and how far you need to go.</p>
<h3>Ending A Session Prematurely</h3>
<p>I built in this feature because I found it beneficial for me to make me explain why I am ending the session early, I found that many times, I resumed the session, and kept plugging on.</p>
<p>If you absolutely have to end the session before it's end, just click the 'x' to close the program same as you would close any other program. It will ask you:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you really want to end the session early (sometimes clicked by accident)</li>
  <li>The reason why you are ending the session early. </li>
  <li>After explaining why you are not finishing your session, if you decide that instead you would like to resume, click the 'Resume Session' Button, and it will pick up right where you left off.</li>
  <li>If you decide that the reason is good enough and that you need end early, click the 'End Session' Button. This will end the session and close the program, and will write your reason to your local (NOT online) db.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can view a list of the reasons you ended early by clicking the 'View Premature Endings' Button on the main program window (top right). I found this helps me avoid interruptions in the future, and plan accordingly so I can spend more time practicing and progressing.</p>
