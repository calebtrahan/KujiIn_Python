<p>Hello And Welcome To The Kuji-In Program.</p>
<p>     I designed this program to be an aid to fellow practitioners of the Kuji-In through the use of brainwave entrainment technology.</p>
<p>     I have packed many features into this program, such as random ambience generation during the session, a goal setting and achieving feature, a non-invasive way to display information during the session, and an export feature if you want to take your created sessions on the go and a few more.</p>
<p>     I have included short tutorials to get you up to speed on how to use the various features of this program. Click the &quot;Tutorials\' button below to read them, and get started</p>
